### Groundstation
We used an ESP32 Wireless Stick to receive info from the payload and write to file. <br>
It uploaded the file to this [github repository](https://github.com/sonyamonyaa/SpaceLog/tree/main) every half an hour. <br>
### Launch

### Results
The connectionion between the payload and the ground station was stable. <br> 
Some kilometers after crossing the border to Jordan the GPS unit seems to have stopped updating. <br>
The sent packet had a decreasing signal strength, but the gps information was constant. <br>
As the rssi signal keep decreasing, we assume the unit kept floating. <br>
